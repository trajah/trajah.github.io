     <p><i>Gelassenheit </i>is the German word for being yielded to God’s will, and in more modern translations, serenity. <i>Ordnung</i>, is the German word for order and discipline.  The Amish believe that <i>Ordnung </i>is a tool to producing Gelassenheit. Discipline and a simple way of life will lead to living in God’s will and serenity.  <i>Gelassenheit </i>places emphasis on obedience. 
<i>Rumspringa</i> is a time for young people to gallivant, explore, and find a mate. With this freedom they can make their decision to remain in the Amish community or leave it. 
</p><p>A major clue to the Amish's survival is their mobile sancturary. Every other Sunday church service is held in a different Amish home. This embodies Getassenhut. The reason a church district never excedes 50 families is because that is the maximum number of people that any family home can accomodate on Church Sunday. Young married couples sign up to take their turn hosting church services during one of the warm months because generally their houses are smaller. Overflow can sit outside. Or church services may be held outside completely. If this is done then tree trunks will be whitewashed six feet up from the ground. The Amish hold church services every two weeks. Those Sunday services are called "Church Sunday" and last about three hours each. Baptisms, confession, ordination and feet washing take place within church gatherings. The two most holy occasions in an Amish church service are communion and baptism. The three after that are marriage, confession and transfer of a leadership office. If you miss Church Sunday services three times in a row you will be disciplined.

         <h3 align="left">Cultivators Of The Earth Farming and Other Work</h3>
<p>When the Amish buy a farm from a an Englischer it takes them five years to build the soil back up as a result of being depleted by the use of commercial fertilizers. To an Amish farmer his relationship with soil has spiritual meaning. The land is not to be sold or exploited. Rather, it is revered. In fact the Amish have a saying, "good soil makes a strong church." The condition of the Amish's land is believed to be a reflection of the Amish people. The average Amish farm is forty acres because that is the size that's manageable when working the land with horses or mules. In other words, the horse limits the size of Amish farms. The Amish family farm is a place to live, raise a family, to be as self-sufficient as possible growing as much food as they can. Work is a moral directive for all Amish. Profits are plowed back into the land so the next generation can live, raise and support their family on it. Amish families enjoy their work. and liesure but their love of work is predominant because they believe work binds the individual to the church, group and family. Work is perceived by the Amish as a calling, not a personal career. Amish believe that labor saving technology undermines the sacred ritual of work. And one of the pluses of plowing a field with a horse rather than with a tractor is that the Amish farmer can get into their fields earlier in the spring. Thats because horses pack the ground less then tractors do. Horses in the field protect the Amish identity, tractors in the farmyard keep them competitive. Many settlements allow the owning of a tractor but the wheels must be removed, then the tractor is loaded on a wagon and is pulled place to place by work horses. The tractor is used for its belt power. Field and farmyard work unfolds as follows:
<ul><li>First alfalfa (hay) cut is in June. </li>
<li>Grain harvest (threshing) is in July.</li> 
<li>Hauling straw takes place in August. </li>
<li>Corn and potato harvest is in September.</li><li> Filling silos in September.</li><li> Butchering in January. </li><li>Plowing In March. </li><li>Planting in May.</li></ul> Of course while the men are doing this work, women are planting their gardens and tending to them all summer long. Amish women are superb gardeners. When the produce starts coming in canning season ensues. Amish wives and daughters are constantly cooking, baking and cleaning. Amish kitchens used to be outfitted with wood cookstoves but now they have more modern ranges that have been converted to burn kerosene. Wringer washers are now outfitted with small gas engines or can be run by gasolene run generators. Freshly laundered clothes are hung outside on the clothesline, usually year round, to dry.
