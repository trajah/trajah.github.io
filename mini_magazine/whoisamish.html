	<h1>Background- Who are the Amish</h1>
    <p>The Amish are a group of people who first arrived in America in 1737.  Since then the Amish people have lived in the United States and Canada.  The Amish were persecuted in Europe because they did not fall in line with the beliefs of the Catholic Church.  Some of the beliefs in which they differed are that people should not be baptized as babies, but as adults when they can confess their faith, and that the statutes in the Catholic Church were idols and should not be worshiped.  As a result of their convictions the Amish were greatly persecuted.  Since the government and the Catholic Church, in Europe during 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, were intertwined, and the Church dictated the government in many aspects, there was no help for the Amish who were burned at the stake or beheaded as heretics.  With no other way out, the Amish eventually made their way to America looking for religious freedom.  The Amish have memorialized these martyrs in their hymns

The Amish arrived in America in the 16th century. They were trying to escape the persecution, in Europe, for their beliefs.  The Amish of Lancaster arrived in the 1720â€™s. Pennsylvania Dutch is the primary oral language of all Amish, with an exception of a small minority of Swiss Amish who speak Bernese Swiss German. Pennsylvania Dutch is not a derivation of the Dutch language but is a dialect of German.
