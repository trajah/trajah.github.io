    <h1>Men</h1>
    <p>The Amish are a patriarchal society. The male is the head of the family and men take on visible roles. Women are also respected for their contributions as wives and mothers. 
The role of a husband among other things is to earn income and deal with outside issues. 
</p>
<h1>Women</h1>
<p>In preparation for church services women play an important role by preparing their homes. Women also vote during church decision making. </p>
<h1>Married Men</h1>
<p>Under Amish views divorce is consider a sin and is forbidden. Marriage is founded more on respect rather than romance.</p> 
<h1>Married Women</h1><p>Wives are expected to obey and yield to the decisions of their husbands as long as it doesn’t conflict with the Ordnung.  The wife’s role as the caretaker of the children and the home is respected.</p>
