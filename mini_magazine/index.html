 <p>The Amish are Anabaptists. What this means is that back in the 1700's the Anabaptist's broke with the church's mandate of being baptized at birth. Anabaptists believe that a person must be old enough to know what baptisim is and means and freely choose it for themselves. They were persecuted for this belief.
 
 The Menno Amish hail from the Netherlands and the Ammann Amish hail from Bern, Switzerland.

The Amish never let themselves forget the bloody persecution of their forefathers. It is deeply rooted in their historical memory and woven into their daily lives. It's serves to keep them seperate and strong as a community. The first Amish to immigrate to America came in the 1800's and settled in Pennsylvania. The Amish historically have been an agrarian based society. But in these modern times where farm land prices have escalated so quickly, unless a young Amish family is willing to relocate, leaving their community behind, the men are forced to work construction or factory jobs.

This constant contact with the outside world can bring its own pressures on the traditionally insular Amish people. The Amish believe in the theology of submission called Gelassenheit. Gelassenheit recycles the individual's energies for the community's purpose, it suppresses individualism for the good of the whole community.

Gelassenheit requires that each individaul should strive to be reserved, modest, calm and quiet. They should hold and express the values of submission, obedience, humility, simplicity. It requires that their dress ( through their dress they bare witness to their faith, spiritual beliefs and humility), use of horses, carriages and lanterns should act as symbols of their faith and beliefs. The structure of their community should be small, informal, local and decentralized.

Finally Gelassenheit requires that the rituals of baptism, confession, ordination and feet washing (this is a ritualizing of the virtue of humility. It takes place during their autumn and communion services) be practiced.

A good motto to help us Englischers truly understand the Amish and what they are about is "a people apart - a people together." Finally there are many variables from one Amish community to the next when it comes to specific rules that are spelled out by the local Ordnung. That's because each district draws up its own Ordnung. So the rules mentioned in this book are general rules and there are multiple variations on them depending on any given Amish community.
